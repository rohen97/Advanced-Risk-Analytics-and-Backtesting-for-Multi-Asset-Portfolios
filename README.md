# Advanced-Risk-Analytics-and-Backtesting-for-Multi-Asset-Portfolios
• Backtested multiple VaR models on a tech-heavy equity portfolio using rolling windows and evaluated model performance via Kupiec and Christoffersen tests, assessing model robustness across confidence levels and market regimes.

• Built and compared trading portfolios (Risk Parity, Maximum Diversification, Equally Weighted) based on CVaR contributions, analysing trade-offs in drawdowns, VaR breaches, and Sharpe ratios to inform allocation under different volatility environments.

• Simulated bond price risk under interest rate shocks, applying delta, delta-gamma, and full revaluation methods to compute multi-horizon VaR and Expected Shortfall—key for fixed income trading desks managing convexity risk.

• Priced and stress-tested an options portfolio using Monte Carlo simulations and Black-Scholes inputs, calculating Marginal and Component VaR/ES to identify key risk drivers and inform hedging decisions in non-linear derivative exposures.
